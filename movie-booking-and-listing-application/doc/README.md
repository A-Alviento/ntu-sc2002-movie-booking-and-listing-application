# How to create
You must first cd into the `movie-booking-and-listing-application` directory first.
```
> cd movie-booking-and-listing-application
> ls
bin data doc src
```

You also need to install the JDK (Java development kit), which comes separate from JRE (java runtime environment).
```
> "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-19\bin\javadoc.exe"  -d doc -author -private -noqualifier all -version -sourcepath .\src ui io model
```
