# Movie Booking and Listing Management Application (OOP Java Project)

A Console-based application to computerize the process of making online booking and purchase of movie tickets, listing of movies and sale reporting.

## Getting Started

#### Navigate Project
- `data` stores application data.
-  `doc` contains the generated javadoc.
-  `src` contains the source code for our file.

#### Run
- Using IDE (works with Eclipse)
  - Run `Main.java` for the pogram, `FillDatabaseMain.java` to fill the app database (note that the database has already been filled). 

##### Alternative (make)
- Enter the `src` directory and run `make`. Tested with `GNUMake` but other versions should work too.

##### FileNotFound 
- If a **file not found error** is received, change `MODELDATABASEPATH` in `Main.java` according to the path that you are in.
